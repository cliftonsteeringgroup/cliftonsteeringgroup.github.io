  <h3>Background</h3>
  
<p>As you will know all tenents of allotments managed by Rugby Bougough Council received a letter from Chris Worman the Parks & grounds Manager on the 10th of 

February 2017. The letter advised that in the current financial situation the council was reviewing how it manages allotments around Rugby and proposed that we the 

allotment holders should take on the management by forming an Allotment Association(s)</p>
<p>Subsequently a public meeting was held on the 16th of March at the Benn Hall</p>
<p>Further metings for individual sites are planned but as yet RBC have not set any dates<p>
<p>In order to achive the most from the future meeting with RBC the tenents of the Clifton Road site held their own meeting on the 8th of April at St Peter's with 

aproximately 28 plot holders attending.</p>
<P>At that meeting it was decided that we feel that the best way forward is to progress discussions with RBC for the process of entering into an agreement for 

"devolved management " of the Clifton road site.<p>
<p>The meeting therefore decided that a "steering committee " will now start the process moving this forward with a view to getting discussions underway as soon as 

possible , with a view to hopefully take over management control of the site with effect from Jan1 2018.</p>
<p>We will be forming a formal association and will be calling upon the NSALG to assist us in the this matter.</p>
<p>During our discussions on Saturday a number of specific points were raised by plot holders that we feel need further explanation/ discussion with RBC so that we 

are in a better informed position to understand where our responsibilities lie in respect of the actual site. these are can be found on our Frequently Asked 

Questions page , but are by far not complete and no doubt further discussions will bring out further questions.<p>
